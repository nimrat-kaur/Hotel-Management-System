### Requirements

#### User Interface
The User interface required to be developed for the system should be user friendly and attractive.

There are two sets of java APIs for graphics programming:

AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) and Swing.
AWT API was introduced in JDK 1.0. 
Most of the AWT components have become obsolete and should be replaced by newer Swing components.

Swing API, a much more comprehensive set of graphics libraries that enhances the AWT, was introduced as part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) after the release of JDK 1.1. JFC consists of Swing, Java2D, Accessibility, Internationalization, and Pluggable Look-and-Feel Support APIs. JFC was an add-on to JDK 1.1 but has been integrated into core Java since JDK 1.2.


#### Software Interfaces 

Programming Language - Java

Back End Tool - MySql 5.5 command line client
